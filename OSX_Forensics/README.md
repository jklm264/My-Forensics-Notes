# TLDR
**At the moment, I cannot find any FORENSIC acqusition tools which work on Mojave, or Catalina**
	* Take another look at [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) and [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
* The trusted tools are OSXpmem and [Macquisition(paid)](https://www.blackbagtech.com/products/macquisition/) for acquisition

# OSX vs MacOS Difference
If you want to get technical, the answer is [yes](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-differences-between-macOS-and-OS-X):

* macOS describes the Apple operating system designed to run on Apple laptop and desktop computers starting with version numbers 10.12 and later.
* OS X describes the Apple operating system designed to run on Apple laptop and desktop computers starting with version number 10.8 through 10.11.
