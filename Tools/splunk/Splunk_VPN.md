# Security & Remote Access: VPN & RWI 4/14/20

## VPN and Network Impact ("Remote Work Insights")

- What is a VPN? duh. Ya gonna see IPSec
- What problems do they create?
  - The overhead of being "[oversubscribed](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/oversubscribed)"
- Netflow
  - Generated by routers and firewalls
    - Cisco ISE/Forescout, Gigamon, other Netflow collectors
  - Doesn't include the payload of the conversation (smaller packets); full fidelity (protocol, size, etc) but half the size!
  - [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow)

- How can Splunk help
  - Can tell you:
    - How much bandwidth
    - What applications are consuming the most bandwidth (Zoom?, WebX?, etc)
    - Can see who's (not) working from home
    - Bandwidth/Host
    - "Top Apps" pane
  - Knowing this can allow for great predictions

## Mapping Remote Work Activity

- Use `iplocation` cmd
  - Ex: `sourcetype=access_* status>=400 | head 20 | iplocation clientip | table clientip, status, City, Country`
  - Splunk leverages [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) GeoIP database to resolve
- All we need is an IP, which can be found in any log
- Can also use *Maps+ for Splunk* that is in [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3124/)

## Things to Look up later
