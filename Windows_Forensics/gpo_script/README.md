# GPO Script

Based on prior experience there seems to be a need to assist organizations to automatically enable much of their logging on various Windows machines. This in turn will enable yourselves, along with 3rd party incident responders to more easily address any security incident which may occur now and in the future.

**NOTE** This does not have correct paths but the idea is that it should automagically set up "better" GPO rules that have none.

## PreReqs
