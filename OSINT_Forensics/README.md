## Notes from Presentations

- [BlackHills OSINT 2-13](BlackHills_Webcast[2-13-20]-OSINT.md)
  - HR is your friend during OSINT. Use various tools. Don't forget about website certificates for enumeration. Also spiderfoot and recon-ng are great.
- [BlackHills Cyber Threat Hunting Training 3-4-20](BHCyber_Threat_Hunting_Training.md)
  - Check outgoing connections when threat hunting. Bro is a great FOSS tool. Includes "The steps" to threat hunting.
- [BlackHills Active Defense & Cyber Deception (ACDC) Training Course 4-9-20](BHLongTraining.md)
  - Observe-Orient-Decide-Act Loop. Canary Tokens are super useful, and so are honeypots.
- [SpecterOps Remote Team Project Management and Reporting Construction 3-10-20](SpecterOps_TeamMgmtandReporting.md) 
  - Having templates and guides memorized will help flow in the after-action reports; and for end-user understanding purposes. Can automate most of this via Skelton files (vim) or simple macros/bash scripting.
