- Everything refers back to a companyâ€™s governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) policies

### Security incident Response Simulations (SIRS):

1. Find issue
2. Identify skilled engineers - need those to builders and testers
3. Build realistic model
4. Build and test scenario elements
5. Invite other security individulas and cross-org participants
6. Run the sim
   - Examples are unauth'd changes to network configuation or resources, publically exposed creds, sensitive content made public via a misconfiguration, or air-gapped webserver that's talking to outside IP.
7. Iterate



### Automation

- Centralization vs Decentralization
- AWS Features: Lambda, Step Functions, Auto Remediation, SSM Agent, Fargate, EC2 (See *Infrastructure Domain Incidents* Steps)
  - Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to capture Volatile Data
- Event-based and periodic scanning
- Runbooks (akin to Splunk Playbooks)
